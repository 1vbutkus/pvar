R package `pvar`
==================================

This package deals with the $p$-variation of the sample. Nonetheless,
it could be used for to calculate $p$-variation for arbitrary
piecewise monotonic function as well.


There are two main functions in this package, namely

* pvar - it is a function that calculates the $p$-variation of the sample.
* PvarBreakTest - it is functions that performs a test of multiple changes in a sequence of independent observations. This
is one of the example of $p$-variation use in statistics.
